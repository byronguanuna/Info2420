    <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time

<h2>Website Critique Jami Lin</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.jamilin.com/#">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>
<ol>
    <li>My first impression of this site was that Jami really 
        wanted her face to be seen with her products</li>
    <li>This website is more of a landing page that takes to other sites. 
        It is organized in the fact that it is just one page and long very long.</li>
    <li>The structure does not make sense as she has multiple links that take to the same place.
        All the links for this page simply take to another page where the structure is basically the same
    </li>
    <li>If this was 2010 than this page would definty fit in place. 
        There are too many images of the same person all over the place and very unpleasing colors.</li>
    <li>The home page loaded very fast. I am guessing because this page has very little information is why it loaded so fast.</li>
    <li>The text color and size were very reasonable for this site. 
        The background color at the top is very unpleasing. It definatly gives a very dated feel for the page </li>
    <li>This site did not have a navigation bar, all it had was links all over the place</li>
    <li>This page does not have a color scheme. As far as I can tell they wanted to include as much color as they could.</li>
    <li>When I resized the page to be smaller everything adjusted very well and looked good.
        Then I noticed at the bottom of the last two sections the last few words were covered up by the links so it did not resize 100% correctly.
    </li>
    <li>What made this site unusual was definatly all the images of the same person.
        What this site did very well was that it was organized in getting you to the right page. 
    </li>
